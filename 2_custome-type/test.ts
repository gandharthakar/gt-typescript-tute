// Basically there are 3 Core Types.
// A number, Boolean & String.
// But in Typescript you are able to define your own types.
// This is the example of 'Type Inference'.

let type:5;

// type = 10; // ! This is wrong.

type = 5; // This is correct.

var ctype:6;

// ctype = 10; // ! This is wrong.

ctype = 6; // This is correct.

// Note : This will works only with numbers and 'Let || var';
